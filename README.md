# simplified-bundler

A very basic bundler for understanding how bundler works.

## How to run
- `npm install` to install all the required dependency.
- `npm run bundle:example` will bundle the basic example in the included example directory, it will create a main.js file in dist directory. That can be run in a browser directly.
